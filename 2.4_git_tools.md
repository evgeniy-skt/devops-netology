commit `3f235065b9347a758efadc92295b540ee0a5e26e` - Update CHANGELOG.md:
commit `6ae64e247b332925b872447e9ce869657281c2bf` - registry: Fix panic when server is unreachable. Non-HTTP errors previously resulted in a panic due to dereferencing the resp pointer while it was nil, as part of rendering the error message. This commit changes the error message formatting to cope with a nil response, and extends test coverage. Fixes #24384;
commit `5c619ca1baf2e21a155fcdb4c264cc9e24a2a353` - website: Remove links to the getting started guide's old location. Since these links were in the soon-to-be-deprecated 0.11 language section, I think we can just remove them without needing to find an equivalent link;

1. commit `8c928e83589d90a031f811fae52a81be7153e82f` - main: Consult local directories as potential mirrors of providers. This restores some of the local search directories we used to include when searching for provider plugins in Terraform 0.12 and earlier. The directory structures we are expecting in these are different than before so existing directory contents will not be compatible without restructuring, but we need to retain support for these local directories so that users can continue to sideload third-party provider plugins until the explicit, first-class provider mirrors configuration (in CLI config) is implemented, at which point users will be able to override these to whatever directories they want. This also includes some new search directories that are specific to the operating system where Terraform is running, following the documented layout conventions of that platform. In particular, this follows the XDG Base Directory specification on Unix systems, which has been a somewhat-common request to better support "sideloading" of packages via standard Linux distribution package managers and other similar mechanisms. While it isn't strictly necessary to add that now, it seems ideal to do all of the changes to our search directory layout at once so that our documentation about this can cleanly distinguish "0.12 and earlier" vs. "0.13 and later", rather than having to document a complex sequence of smaller changes. Because this behavior is a result of the integration of package main with package command, this behavior is verified using an e2etest rather than a unit test. That test, TestInitProvidersVendored, is also fixed here to create a suitable directory structure for the platform where the test is being run. This fixes TestInitProvidersVendored.
